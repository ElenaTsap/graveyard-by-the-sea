Digital interpretation of a book binding signed by Paul Bonet in 1956, for the poem “Le Cimetiére Marin”, written by Paul Valéry in 1920.
While taking my first steps in coding, I decided to experiment with illustrations. 
The book cover was redesigned with CSS. I added a very discreet animation to bring the cover to life.
