written by Paul Valéry<br>
         translated from the French by David Pollard</h2>1<br>
This tranquil roof pulsates above the pines<br>
with doves’ sails fluttering beyond the shrines;<br>
while the indifferent noon forges the sea from fire:<br>
the sea will always recommence<br>
or recompense after a thought and take us thence<br>
to the long calm gaze to which the gods aspire.<br><br>
2<br>
What pure and fine-spun lightning can consume<br>
so many diamonds in the ephemeral spume,<br>
and what apparent peace it can bestow!<br>
When, over deeps and deeps, a sun can pause<br>
in the pure work of its eternal cause,<br>
time flickers and the craving is to know.<br>
<br>
3<br>
Shrine to Minerva, treasure, simple sure,<br>
expanse of calmness, visible, secure,<br>
rippling water. Eye that itself can hold<br>
so much of sleep beneath a veil of flame<br>
O silence mine! …Built in the spirit’s frame,<br>
but packed with ore, a million tiles of gold.<br>
<br>
4<br>
I from Time’s temple of a single sigh, resume<br>
my climb to this pure point and to myself attune<br>
all the surrounding vistas of the sea;<br>
and to the gods my offering outright<br>
sows peaceful scintillation on the height<br>
where sovereignty allows disdain to be.<br>
<br>
5<br>
As fruit, on tasting, melts into delight,<br>
dissolving into absence as we bite,<br>
whilst on the lips its very form is dying,<br>
I smell my future here among the smoke<br>
as ashen skies sing to the soul half-choked<br>
by changes in the murmuring banks’ quiet crying.<br>
<br>
6<br>
Beautiful heavens and true, look how I change!<br>
After such pride, after so much that’s strange,<br>
an idleness and yet so full of power,<br>
abandoned as I am to this such brilliant space,<br>
over the houses of the dead my shade can trace<br>
a path that tames me where it could devour.<br>
<br>
7<br>
The soul laid bare to all the flares of solstice,<br>
I do uphold you, admirable justice<br>
and all the brightness of your pitiless blade!<br>
Pure, I return you to your premier place<br>
Look at yourself! …But grant that light must trace<br>
half shadows in its ever bleaker shade.<br>
<br>
8<br>
O for and to and in myself apart,<br>
I, at the poem’s source, its very heart,<br>
between the void and the event so pure,<br>
await the echo of my internal fame,<br>
echoing reservoir that, harsh with shame,<br>
sounds hollow in the soul of the future!<br>
<br>
9<br>
Do you, false captive of this foliage, know<br>
how these thin boughs eat up the outer glow,<br>
how secrets dazzle though my eyes are closed.<br>
What body drags me to a lingering end,<br>
what to the bone-shard earth could make him bend?<br>
One spark can make me think of what is lost.<br>
<br>
10<br>
Fire insubstantial, sacred and enclosed,<br>
earthly fragment to the light exposed,<br>
controlled by torches, this place pleases me,<br>
composed of gold, of stone and shady glades,<br>
where marble trembles over many shades;<br>
and there, upon my tombs, the sleeping, faithful sea!<br>
<br>
11<br>
Resplendent bitch, affright the idolater! while,<br>
solitary and with a shepherd’s smile,<br>
I pasture long with my mysterious sheep;<br>
the white flock of my tranquil tombs,<br>
so that the cautious doves, the vain dream’s perfumes<br>
and curious angels can their distance keep.<br>
<br>
12<br>
Once here the future comes as idleness.<br>
The brittle insect scrapes the dryness;<br>
all is burned, defeated, drawn to air<br>
I cannot tell to what severe essence…<br>
Life is vast, being drunk with absence,<br>
and bitterness is sweet and the mind, clear.<br>
<br>
13<br>
The dead lie easy, hidden in earth where they<br>
and all their mysteries are dried away.<br>
High noon, this motionless and midday blue,<br>
thinks of itself and of its own renown…<br>
a mind complete and perfect crown,<br>
I am the secret change you have in you.<br>
<br>
14<br>
You have me only to contain your fears!<br>
My doubts and my regrets, my closest cares<br>
are in the fault-line of your diamond heart…<br>
But in their night with marbles heavy weighted,<br>
a people vague and to their tree roots mated<br>
have slowly nonetheless taken your part.<br>
<br>
15<br>
Into an absence thick they melt away,<br>
white race drunk up by red clay,<br>
the gift of life has passed into the flowers!<br>
Where are the phrases that the dead control,<br>
a people’s art, the individual soul?<br>
Worms now gnaw where tears once had their hour.<br>
<br>
16<br>
Sharp squeals of girls tickled anew,<br>
the eyes and teeth, the eyelids’ moistening dew,<br>
the charming breast playing within the flame,<br>
the blood that shines on lips so keen to yield,<br>
those final gifts, that fingers aim to shield,<br>
all below ground and back into the game!<br>
<br>
17<br>
And you, great soul, do you expect to dream<br>
of lying colours that no longer seem<br>
like waves or gold made here for fleshy eyes?<br>
When you are merely vapours will you sing?<br>
Go to! All flees! Presence here passes on a wing!<br>
Holy impatience also dies!<br>
<br>
18<br>
Lean immortality, so black and gold,<br>
a laurelled comforter, so ghastly to behold,<br>
that out of death can, from a mother’s breast,<br>
make beautiful untruth and pious ruse!<br>
who nothing knows and nothing can refuse,<br>
that empty skull and that eternal jest!<br>
<br>
19<br>
Heads uninhabited, fathers profound,<br>
under the weight of so much shovelled ground<br>
are now but earth and can our steps deceive.<br>
The real, the gnawing, wriggling worm of doom,<br>
is not for you who sleep beneath the tomb;<br>
and yet devours my life which he will never leave!<br>
<br>
20<br>
Love perhaps, love, yes and self-hatred too?<br>
His secret tooth is near enough and true<br>
that any name I take could suit his whim!<br>
Come now! He sees, he wants, he thinks, can touch<br>
my flesh that pleases him. Even on my couch,<br>
I live my life just to belong to him!<br>
<br>
21<br>
Zeno of Elea, Zeno! Cruel Zeno!<br>
Have you pierced me with that winged arrow<br>
that hums and flies, yet does not fly!<br>
The sound brings forth, the arrow kills!<br>
Ah! sun… What tortoise shadow fills<br>
the soul; Achilles motionless as he strides by!<br>
<br>
22<br>
No, no!… Arise! Into the following age!<br>
My pensive body, pierce this thinking cage!<br>
My breast, drink up the wind’s new drive!<br>
A coolness of the sea exhaled,<br>
returns my soul…with salt regaled!<br>
let’s run the waves and spring from them alive.<br>
<br>
23<br>
Yes! frenzied sea of such delirious spin,<br>
of chlamyde rent and panther skin,<br>
with thousand thousands idols of the sun,<br>
absolute Hydra drunk with your own blue flesh might<br>
coil upon your sparkling tail and bite,<br>
in such an uproar out of silence spun.<br>
<br>
24<br>
The wind awakes!…to try and live is next!<br>
A breath immense opens and shuts my text,<br>
powdery foam springs daring from the rocks!<br>
Fly, fly away my sun bedazzled pages!<br>
Break waves, break, break rejoicing surges<br>
over this tranquil roof where doves’ sails peck in flocks.<br>
