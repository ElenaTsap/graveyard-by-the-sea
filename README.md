Digital interpretation of a [book binding](http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2013/livres-manuscrits-pf1313/lot.187.html) signed by [Paul Bonet](https://www.stephenongpin.com/artist/238576/paul-bonet) in 1956, for the poem [“Le Cimetiére Marin”](https://intranslation.brooklynrail.org/french/the-graveyard-by-the-sea/), written by [Paul Valéry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Val%C3%A9ry) in 1920.

While taking my first steps in coding, I decided to experiment with illustrations. 
The book cover was redesigned with CSS. I added a very discreet animation to bring the cover to life.
